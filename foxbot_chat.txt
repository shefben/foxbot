[GREETINGS]
Hey team, let's have a good game!
Ready for action!
What's up everyone?
Let's show them how it's done!
Time to rock and roll!
Hope you're ready %s!
Good luck, have fun!
Watch my back and I'll watch yours!
Let's capture the flag, squad!
Time to frag some enemies.
Who needs a power-up?

[KILL WINNING]
You can't stop me %s!
I'm dominating this match!
Another one bites the dust!
Stay down %s!
Who's next?
Headshot!
Didn't stand a chance!
Spawn camp success!
Too easy!
I'm on fire!
Looks like I'm unbeatable today!

[KILL LOSING]
Gotcha %s, maybe this will turn things around!
Finally a point for us!
Yes! That's one for the good guys!
Take that %s!
We needed that!
Comeback starts now!
I'll take every advantage I can get!
They won't keep us down!
That's one way to respawn %s!
Keep pushing up!
We're clawing back!

[KILLED WINNING]
Lucky shot %s, I'm still ahead!
Nice hit, but I'm not worried!
You got me %s, but it won't last!
Enjoy that point, I'll be back!
Not bad, but I'm still leading!
Good one %s, I'll get you next time!
That was a surprise!
You won't get many more like that!
I walked right into that trap.
Okay, they've got skills.
Respawning, be right back!

[KILLED LOSING]
Argh %s, I'm having a rough day!
Can't seem to catch a break!
Nicely done %s!
You got me again!
Need to step up my game.
Ouch! That hurt!
They're all over us!
This match is brutal.
They're steamrolling us!
Need backup at the point!
Hold them off while I respawn!

[SUICIDE]
Oops, that didn't go as planned.
Forget you saw that.
I really messed that up!
Someone pretend that didn't happen.
I swear I'm better than this.
That was embarrassing!
Even the best make mistakes.
Let's never speak of this again.
I blew myself up again.
Gravity wins this round.
Note to self: avoid that pit.
