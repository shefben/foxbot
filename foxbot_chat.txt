[GREETINGS]
Hey team, let's have a good game!
Ready for action!
What's up everyone?
Let's show them how it's done!
Time to rock and roll!
Hope you're ready %s!
Good luck, have fun!
Watch my back and I'll watch yours!
Ready to cap some intel?
Medic on standby, let's move!

[KILL WINNING]
You can't stop me %s!
I'm dominating this match!
Another one bites the dust!
Stay down %s!
Who's next?
Too easy!
I'm on fire!
Looks like I'm unbeatable today!
That's another frag for the highlight reel!
Sentry's down and so are you, %s!

[KILL LOSING]
Gotcha %s, maybe this will turn things around!
Finally a point for us!
Yes! That's one for the good guys!
Take that %s!
We needed that!
Comeback starts now!
I'll take every advantage I can get!
They won't keep us down!
Phew, finally got one on the board!
That rocket jump was worth it, %s!

[KILLED WINNING]
Lucky shot %s, I'm still ahead!
Nice hit, but I'm not worried!
You got me %s, but it won't last!
Enjoy that point, I'll be back!
Not bad, but I'm still leading!
Good one %s, I'll get you next time!
That was a surprise!
You won't get many more like that!
Okay %s, I didn't see that sticky trap.
I guess even champions slip up.

[KILLED LOSING]
Argh %s, I'm having a rough day!
Can't seem to catch a break!
Nicely done %s!
You got me again!
Need to step up my game.
Ouch! That hurt!
They're all over us!
This match is brutal.
Their defense is like a fortress!
I keep respawning more than playing.

[SUICIDE]
Oops, that didn't go as planned.
Forget you saw that.
I really messed that up!
Someone pretend that didn't happen.
I swear I'm better than this.
That was embarrassing!
Even the best make mistakes.
I forgot how explosive my rockets are.
Gravity isn't on my side today.
Let's never speak of this again.
